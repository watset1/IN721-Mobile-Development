It&#39;s a big sounding psych, folk, blues mash. Howlin&#39; Wolf, Arthur Lee and Gene Clarke are my holy trinity. I&#39;ve played shows from one end of the long white cloud to the other: bars, libraries, churches, town halls, truck trailers and a gondola. During my travels, I&#39;ve had the honour of sharing the stage with some very talented musicians, including The Eastern, Bill Morris, The Tattle Tale Saints, Mali Mali, Shunkan, Luckless and Violet French.<br><br><br>Early 2015 saw the release of my first EP, Diatom. Just me and guitar laid down on an old Tascam four track; a little nod to eighties and nineties low-fi. I&#39;m no luddite but simplicity is my key. The EP got a bit of an airing around the place, here&#39;s what someone else had to say about it:<br><br><br>&quot;The calm power of Daniel&#39;s songs has a great way of soothing your mind and day, and they also have this driven-ness that energizes you when you hear them, whether it&#39;s been for the first or the fiftieth time.&quot; - Jon Bakos, Radio One 91FM.<br><br><br>I was born in Dunedin, New Zealand. A city Keith Richards hates so much he took the time to mention it in his autobiography. It&#39;s also the city where, on a diet of marmite toast and gumboot tea, I chiselled out my sound on a guitar my uncle made and my father once played.<br><br><br>In 2014 a rusty people mover took me up the road to the suburbs of Christchurch, where I&#39;ve continued to spread my anti-folk vision. I&#39;ve got a new EP in the works and my head is still stuffed full of songs to be written so keep your ears to the ground, there is more of this story to come!<br><br>","modified":"2017-03-18 07:35:46","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Daniel Madill","venue_address":"Crown Roller Mills building, 2 Manor Place","geocode_type":"City Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"NZ","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/087/461-0.jpeg_/daniel-madill-61.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/087/461-0.jpeg_/daniel-madill-61.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/087/461-0.jpeg_/daniel-madill-61.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/087/461-0.jpeg_/daniel-madill-61.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2017-03-18 07:35:46","venue_id":"V0-001-008809789-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"New Edinburgh Folk Club","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/venues/new-edinburgh-folk-club-/V0-001-008809789-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"Pacific/Auckland","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":null,"postal_code":"9016","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"-45.8742748","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/events/mary-poppins-broadway-musical-/E0-001-098285046-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-098285046-7","privacy":"1","city_name":"Dunedin","link_count":null,"longitude":"170.5042076","country_name":"New Zealand","country_abbr":"NZL","region_name":null,"start_time":"2017-05-18 19:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" The Regent Theatre has provided the Dunedin public and the city&#39;s visitors, with the only large live theatre venue in the Otago region since 1973. ...","modified":"2017-03-12 06:25:37","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Mary Poppins - The Broadway Musical","venue_address":"17 Octagon","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"NZ","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/035/658/943-4.jpeg_/mary-poppins-broadway-musical-43.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/035/658/943-4.jpeg_/mary-poppins-broadway-musical-43.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/035/658/943-4.jpeg_/mary-poppins-broadway-musical-43.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/035/658/943-4.jpeg_/mary-poppins-broadway-musical-43.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-12-03 06:10:17","venue_id":"V0-001-000474466-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Regent Theatre","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/venues/regent-theatre-/V0-001-000474466-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"Pacific/Auckland","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":null,"postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"-45.8744926","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/events/university-students-music-month-/E0-001-101105433-3@2017050212?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-101105433-3@2017050212","privacy":"1","city_name":"Dunedin","link_count":null,"longitude":"170.5030388","country_name":"New Zealand","country_abbr":"NZL","region_name":null,"start_time":"2017-05-02 12:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <p>Tuesdays during the month of May (Music Month) students from the University of Otago Department of Music, Theatre & Performing Arts will perform in various gallery spaces.
